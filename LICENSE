## Parameters

Business Source License version 1.1 (BSL v.1.1) is a source-available license that sets three tenets to the license, some of which are customizable and specified by each licensor.
The Business Source License is not an Open Source license. However, the Licensed Work will eventually be made available under an Open Source License, as stated in this License.

1. BSL v.1.1 will always allow copying, modification, redistribution, non-commercial use, and commercial use in a non-production context.
2. By default, BSL does not allow for production use unless the licensor provides a limited right as an **Additional Use Grant** â€“ this piece is customizable and explained below.
3. BSL provides a **Change Date** usually between one to four years in which the BSL license converts to a **Change License** that is open source, which can be GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), Apache, etc.
